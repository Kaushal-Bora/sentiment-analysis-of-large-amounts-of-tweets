# sentiment-analysis-of-large-amounts-of-tweets
One of my first project to explore the domain of NLP. It is a sentiment analysis of around 1million tweets from twitter. Currently it features the Naive Bayes Classifier, but updates on the classifier will be made later.
Simple data preprocessing is done and the TFIDF vectorizer is used.
